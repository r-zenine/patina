//! TDD test-design (red) for Phase 10 — Detector 4: middleman delegation
//! chains (`.plans/plan-patina-detect/implementation-roadmap.md`, Phase 10;
//! `docs/patina-detect/spec.md:165-177`).
//!
//! Like `dead_exports`, this detector's reason to exist is a real
//! `incoming_calls` call through `lspkit::LspClient` against a real
//! `rust-analyzer` process — there is no meaningful pure-unit-test slice of
//! "does this function have exactly one caller" without one. `#[ignore]`d
//! since CI may not have `rust-analyzer` on `PATH`. Run explicitly with:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo test -p patina-detect --test middleman_delegation_detection_tests -- --ignored
//! ```
